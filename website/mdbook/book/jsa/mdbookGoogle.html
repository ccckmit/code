Edward III (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 until his death; he is noted for his military success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, Edward II. Edward III transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of fifty years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death.
</p>
<p>
Edward was crowned at age fourteen after his father was deposed by his mother, Isabella of France, and her lover Roger Mortimer. At age seventeen he led a successful coup against Mortimer, the de facto ruler of the country, and began his personal reign. After a successful campaign in Scotland he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1337 but his claim was denied. This started what became known as the Hundred Years' War.[1] Following some initial setbacks the war went exceptionally well for England; victories at Crécy and Poitiers led to the highly favourable Treaty of Brétigny. Edward's later years, however, were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inactivity and poor health.
</p>
<p>
Edward III was a temperamental man but capable of unusual clemency. He was in many ways a conventional king whose main interest was warfare. Admired in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.[2][3]

# The oral defense of 萬磁王

Today is the oral defense of the ESP department in X university.

In the beginning, 萬磁王 comes in and the committee's cup fly to salute.

After that, 萬磁王 has a show. He sucks all metal object to the door, and then blocking the exit of the classroom. 

Suddenly, president Obama fly into the classroom from window, because of his metal belt.

When Obama was dizzy and can not figure out what happened. We saw the night is coming, because  萬磁王 turn the earth upside down。
 
After the show, a committee member ask the first question .
 
Committee member A said : 

> We have read your Dr Thesis in title "A research of ESP that moving any metal objects". But you have not enough citation and reference in your thesis. For example, you do not cite my paper with title "A research about which hair moving first when flagellate is moving".

At that time, there was shadows show on 萬磁王's face. When 魔形女 saw it, her hair stand up. 
 
And then, committee member B said :
 
> Could you please explain the meaning of "the equation of manipulate magnetic field by human body" ? 
 
Suddenly, you saw the 萬磁王 explain quickly and write on the blackboard without moving his hand.
In fact, he manipulate a chalk with metal ring flying to write on the blackboard。
 
Finally, the committee member C said :
 
> I think your thesis has some weak point. Because you can move metal but can not move the other objects. Your research is not good enough. So you should have another research about the topic of manipulate gravity. 
 
At the end of oral defense , committee members have the conclusion that 萬磁王 should stay for one more year to have another research for the topic "A method of manipulate gravity".
